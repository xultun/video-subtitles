Hello. Today I will teach you how to set up OBS

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to record in high quality.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
First, go to Settings, then to Video.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Select the resolution 1920 by 1080.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And set the FPS to sixty.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Next, go to Settings and enter Output.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Go to the Recording tab.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Choose MKV format. Use the HEVC encoder.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And keep the output scale

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
at 1920 by 1080.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now, in the encoding settings.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Select CBR with a bitrate of thirty-five thousand.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Preset P five.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Profile Main. GPU zero. And a maximum of two B frames.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
With these settings, your OBS recordings

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
will have excellent quality and smoothness.
